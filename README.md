# Public Api Requests
 Practice more Api request for a better understanding
I’ll use the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/)
to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data
to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

I’ll request a JSON object from the API and parse the data so
that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image,
full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name
will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the
employee’s birthday and address.

I will  use jQuery with this project since I havent used it in any of my projects
While there are plugins that can help.
with the creation of a gallery and modal setup, it is important for
developers to be able to understand how tools like that work "under
the hood". So you'll need to write all your own JS or jQuery to create
the necessary functionality for this project.
